## Project Overview

The Hotel Management System is designed to streamline operations for both hotel employees and guests. It offers functionalities for customers, such as searching for available rooms, making reservations, checking in and out, and generating invoices. Employees can manage room availability, maintain customer profiles, and oversee housekeeping schedules. This project includes a set of RESTful APIs built with Spring Boot to enable the development of frontend interfaces for web and mobile platforms.
